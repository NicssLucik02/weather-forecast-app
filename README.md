DEMOLINK: https://nicsslucik02.github.io/weather-forecast-app/

An application for displaying real-time weather forecasts.
The user can search for cities manually or get the forecast automatically based on their geolocation.
The interface dynamically changes its appearance (colors, background, and icons) depending on the current weather conditions — sunny, rainy, snowy, cloudy, etc.

Main possibilities:
🔍 Search for weather by city name
📍 Detect the user's location using geolocation
🌡️ Display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other parameters
🎨 Responsive design that changes depending on the weather
⚡ TypeScript-based typing for code reliability
